# How to Contribute

If you're a group member and want to add or edit your GitHub profile information:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git

```

3. Open the README.md file in your preferred text editor.
4. Find your group and update the GitHub Profile column with your actual GitHub username.

```bash
| #   | Name                             | GitHub Profile                 |
| --- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| ... | ...                              | ...                            |
```

5. Save the changes.
6. Commit and push the changes to your forked repository.

```bash
git add README.md
```

```bash
git commit -m "Update GitHub profiles for Group X"
```

```bash

```

8. Create a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository.
Your changes will be reviewed, and once approved, they will be merged into the main repository.
